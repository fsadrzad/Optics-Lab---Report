# Optics-Lab---Report


The objective was to measure the visible spectrum of a sample of intralipid and methylene blue with unknown concentrations. The sample was scanned in both transmission and reflectance mode, and mu_a and mu_s'optical parameters were computed through the inverse adding doubling method. After, using the reference values of mu_a and mu_s' values in the literature, the unknown concentrations of methylene blue and intralipid were computed.
